## Overview
I used this repository to run mock interviews for students from the Ada tech school.

## Interview questions
- Fix the bug where the mower exits the lawn and then returns
- Track score (number of tiles of lawn mowed)
- Implement a way to speed the game up
- Highlight the last 3 tiles the mower has mowed
- Add random behavior changes to the mower (the way a Roomba does it)
- Stop the game when the lawn is mowed, or after some time has passed
- Feel free to fix any bug along the way!
